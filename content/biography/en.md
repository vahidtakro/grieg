Edvard Grieg (1843–1907) was a Norwegian composer and pianist whose music helped define a national style in the Romantic era. His works often weave folk‑inspired melodies with rich harmony and lyricism.

After studies in Leipzig, Grieg returned to Norway and became a central cultural figure. He is best known for the Peer Gynt suites, the Piano Concerto in A minor, and the Lyric Pieces for solo piano.
