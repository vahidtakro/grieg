# Norwegian Dances, Op. 35

Composed in 1881, the Norwegian Dances represent Grieg's successful adaptation of traditional Norwegian folk tunes for piano four-hands. These four dances showcase his ability to preserve the authentic character of folk music while creating sophisticated concert pieces.

## Background and Inspiration

The work was inspired by traditional Norwegian folk tunes that Grieg collected and arranged. Each dance reflects different aspects of Norwegian folk culture, from lively celebrations to more contemplative moments.

## The Four Dances

- **Modal harmonies** derived from folk music traditions
- **Virtuosic writing** for both piano parts
- **Dynamic contrasts** that enhance the dance character

### II. Allegretto tranquillo e grazioso
A graceful, flowing dance with a more lyrical character:
- **Gentle, flowing melodies** with folk-like contours
- **Delicate textures** that allow the melody to shine
- **Subtle harmonic colors** that add depth without complexity

### III. Allegro moderato alla marcia
A march-like dance with a processional character:
- **Steady, marching rhythms** that build momentum

### IV. Allegro molto
A brilliant finale with the most virtuosic writing:
