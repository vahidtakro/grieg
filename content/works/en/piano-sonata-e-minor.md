# Piano Sonata in E minor, Op. 7

Composed in 1865 when Grieg was just 22 years old, the Piano Sonata in E minor represents his only contribution to the piano sonata genre. This substantial early work showcases his command of classical forms while revealing his emerging personal style and the influences that would shape his later compositions.
