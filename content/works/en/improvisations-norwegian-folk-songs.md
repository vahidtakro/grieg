# Improvisations on Two Norwegian Folk Songs, Op. 29

Composed in 1878, the Improvisations on Two Norwegian Folk Songs represent Grieg's deepening engagement with Norwegian folk music and his growing commitment to creating a distinctly Norwegian musical voice. These works demonstrate his ability to transform traditional folk melodies into sophisticated concert pieces while preserving their authentic character.

## Background and Composition

The improvisations were composed during a period when Grieg was increasingly focused on developing a Norwegian national style in music. This work reflects his mature understanding of folk music traditions and his skill in adapting them for the concert hall while maintaining their essential character.

### 2. Improvisation on "Stabbe-Låtten"
The second improvisation, based on another folk song:
- **Transforms the folk melody** into a concert piece
