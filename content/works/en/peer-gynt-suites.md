# Peer Gynt Suites, Op. 46 & 55

Originally composed as incidental music for Henrik Ibsen's play *Peer Gynt*, these suites became some of Grieg's most popular orchestral works.

## Suite No. 1, Op. 46

1. **Morning Mood** - A serene depiction of dawn breaking over the mountains
2. **The Death of Åse** - A mournful elegy for Peer's mother
3. **Anitra's Dance** - An exotic, seductive dance in 3/4 time
4. **In the Hall of the Mountain King** - A dramatic, building crescendo

## Suite No. 2, Op. 55

1. **Ingrid's Lament** - A sorrowful melody
2. **Arabian Dance** - Oriental-inspired with chromatic harmonies
3. **Peer Gynt's Homecoming** - A stormy sea voyage
4. **Solveig's Song** - A tender, lyrical conclusion

These suites showcase Grieg's mastery of orchestration and his ability to create vivid musical imagery that perfectly captures the dramatic essence of Ibsen's play.
